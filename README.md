# Data Structures and Algorithm Solutions

This repository is a collection of solutions to common Data Structures and Algorithm problems. The primary goal is to serve as a good-quality resource for anyone studying for technical interviews, preparing for coding competitions, or simply looking to understand the solutions for the DSA problems.

## What You'll Find in Each Solution ?
Every solution is designed to be a complete learning setup guide, including -

- Problem Statement: A clear summary of the problem is written.
- Approach: An explanation of the chosen method, including the logic and time complexity with its reason behind it.
- Time & Space Complexity: A detailed analysis of the solution's efficiency.
- Programming language used: C++
